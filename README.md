<div>Hello ðŸ‘‹,
My name is Jonathan, I am a Front-End developer. Passionate about computer codes and digital design since my youth, I decided to devote all my time to it by combining work and passion. Creative, attentive and eternally dissatisfied, I am always looking for the slightest evolution or a new Framework to use. I code in HTML, CSS, JS, React and master various frameworks like Boostrap, Bulma, Materialize, vue.jsâ€¦

On the graphic side, this was my first training. I create all print or digital media (logo, graphic charter, flyer, model, brochure, poster, magazine, business card, website, etc.). I use for this Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign or After Effects depending on the nature of the work. I remain at your disposal for any graphic requests or web development collaboration and wish you a good visit.</div>
